      <h2>4th of July Party</h2>
      <p>“At first when thinking about adding Independence Day decorations, I thought about getting some flags and a couple of balloons for a party I was throwing. I reached out to Heather who suggested a balloon garland, so I said “Sure, why not!” but I had no idea what would come out of that conversation. Her design far outweighed any expectations I had. I was no longer having just a backyard BBQ, but a true celebration. 5 star service all the way!” </p>
